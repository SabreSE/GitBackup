# GitBackup

A Basic tool for backing up all Repos in a Git Organisation to a local storage device, where further backups can be taken.

This was created just to give me a bit of peace and mind over acidential damage from team members or bad actors. 

For now I run this with just a simple Windows task schedule, and it gets the job done.
